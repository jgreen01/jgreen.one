    <h1>Hi, I’m Jon.</h1>
    <p><b>I’m a senior software developer</b> who enjoys turning complex problems into simple, reliable systems. My day‑to‑day work spans frontend development, backend services, and cloud infrastructure with a bias toward clarity, tests, and proven tech.</p>
    <p><b>I’m also studying data science (MCS‑DS)</b>, building a bridge between solid engineering and applied ML.</p>
    <p><b>Beyond code</b>, I contribute to DEIB efforts, practice meditation, learn Portuguese, spend time with family, and I’m a regular blood donor.</p>
    <p>This site collects selected projects and occasional writing. <i>If our interests align, I’m open to thoughtful collaboration.</i></p>
